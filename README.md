# MovieMeter

MovieMeter is a Django-based web application that allows users to search for movies, view movie details, and submit movie reviews. The app integrates with the OMDb API to fetch movie data such as titles, posters, ratings, and other relevant details. Users can search for movies, filter results, and view popular films, while also contributing their own reviews.

2. Search Movies: Use the search bar on the homepage to look up movies by title or filter them by rating.

3. View Movie Details: Click on any movieâ€™s "View Details" button to see more information.

4. Submit Reviews: Users can submit their own reviews for any movie and rate it out of 5.

5. Popular Movies: The homepage displays a list of popular movies fetched using the OMDb API.

## Challenges

1. API Errors: Occasionally, the OMDb API would time out or fail due to server issues. I implemented retry logic to handle failed requests gracefully, allowing the app to retry the API request until it succeeds.
   
2. Reverse URL Matching: Encountered a NoReverseMatch error when working with movie titles that contain special characters. This was fixed using URL encoding to ensure proper routing.

3. Pagination: Managing the display of large sets of movie data required adding pagination to avoid overwhelming users with too much information at once.

4. Deployment: Configuring the deployment on PythonAnywhere had a few challenges, such as setting up the correct paths and managing static files. These issues were resolved with proper configurations.

## Future Enhancements

1. User Authentication: Add advanced user authentication features like social login (Google, Facebook, etc.).
   
2. Ratings System: Allow users to upvote or downvote reviews to highlight useful feedback.
   
3. Watchlist: Let users add movies to their personal watchlist and track movies they plan to watch.
   
4. Improved UI/UX: Make further improvements to the UI, such as adding animations, transitions, and enhanced mobile responsiveness.

5. Advanced Filtering: Provide more detailed filtering options such as genre, year of release, or director for a refined search experience.
